# Use of the space

Phase-0 students are welcome to use the Dev Academy space during Phase-0. We have a number of desks free, but they are limited.The space will be available during office hours (9 am - 5.30pm) Monday - Friday. You will need to bring your own laptop.

## Appropriate use of the space
- Keep the desk area clean.
- Don't leave personal items at a desk
- Do your dishes!
- leave the space better than you found it.
- When possible, return furniture to where it was set when you entered the space, and clean the space even if you did not create the mess.
